**By Krisha and Saanvi - Neev Academy**

*Stonehill Hackathon*



**Parts of our Website**
- Info on materials - how to recycle, chracteristics (This is so people can effectively use, buy and recycle materials)
- Several chats where people can list items they don't need for other people to pick up(This is becuase a lot of times even products in good condition are thrown out when they aren't needed)
